## Model Based Design applied to a DC Motor Controller

As we build "Smarter" electromechanical systems, Model Based Design (MBD) allows you to quickly and effectively build such control systems while effectively exploring your design options.

Controlling a DC motor is perfect to show off a variety of products that are a part of MBD.
The demo is setup to demo a range of products, as well as key modeling features.

### Relevant Products ###
  * Simulink, Simscape, Parallel Computing Toolbox, Simulink Design Optimization, Simulink Control Design, Embedded Coder, Simulink Test, Stateflow

### Simulink Platform Features ###
  * Data Inspector, Signal Editor, MultiSim with SimulationInput Objects, Model and Subsystem References, Data Dictionaries, Dashboards, Simulation Pacing, Masks and Callbacks, Apps, (Code) Perspective Views, Test Harnesses, Software-in-Loop Setup, Annotations and Areas, Continuous Integration

## Relevant Industries
